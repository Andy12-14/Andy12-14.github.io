<p> The highly anticipated super middleweight showdown between Saul "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford, initially scheduled for September at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, has been canceled. The Ring Magazine reported the cancellation on February 5, 2025, but did not provide specific reasons for this development.</p>
<p> This news has left boxing fans disappointed, as the matchup between these two pound-for-pound greats was expected to be one of the year's most significant events. Crawford, the WBA junior middleweight champion, was set to move up two weight classes to challenge Álvarez for his super middleweight titles</p>
